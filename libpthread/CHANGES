  Ups... did the wrong error handling... the error is returned not put to
  errno...
  probably thread_key is not SMP save...

  added conditional variables...
  except pthread_cond_timedwait all should work man-page like
  pthread_cond_timedwait dosen't handle cancel request according to man-page

  added thread specific key handling (all according to man-page)

  uff found some logic errors and fixed them.
  pthread_create had a problem with user provided stacks.

  arg.. the kernel-header are so inconsistent...
  on x86 it works on arm and sparc not due to MISSING defines, miss-places
  includes and __KERNEL__ checks....
  the best in this category is that the kernel-header are changed that the
  buggy (g)libc haven't to change... (f..k glibc, the headers HAVE to be
  CONSISTENT)
  a public defined symbol on arch X have to be in Y to unless marked...
  that is mainly speaking SCHED.H ! arg....

  I have implemented the "Manager Thread" so that nested thread creation
  works. really ugly stuff... don't look at it unless you're sitting on solid
  ground.

  first of all:
  I strongly suggest NOT to use it yet, it's very, very, ... very
  experimental. I guess you got the point. there is still much debug code,
  incomplete functions and unusable states....

  I'm still working on the final alpha...
